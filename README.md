## Reading corner

### Books

#### Design/ Thinking
* [The Design of Everyday Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) (Donald Norman): how users use objects, and how to optimize and standardize things and make them more intuitive and user-friendly

#### Programming
* [The Art of Readable Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8677004-the-art-of-readable-code) (Dustin Boswell & Trevor Foucher): a basic principles and practical techniques that one can apply to write a better code

#### Relaxing on a hammock under a tree...
* [What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662-what-if-serious-scientific-answers-to-absurd-hypothetical-questions) (Randall Munroe)

### Articles

#### Unreliable Science (*and how to try overcome this issue)

* *Why Most Published Research Findings Are False* (PLOS/ John Ioannidis) | [Paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) / [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Most_Published_Research_Findings_Are_False): an essay written by John Ioannidis (Stanford School of Medicine); author argues that a large number of papers in medical research contain results that in fact cannot be replicated and are a false positive results
* *How scientists fool themselves – and how they can stop* (Nature/ Regina Nuzzo) | [Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/526182a) / [PDF](https://www.nature.com/articles/526182a.pdf): cognitive fallacies in research and debiasing techniques
* *Power failure: why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience* (Nature/ Katherine S. Button et al.) | [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3475): low statistical power and its influence on true/false effects
* *Scanning the horizon: towards transparent and reproducible neuroimaging research* (Nat Rev Neurosci/ Russell A. Poldrack et al.) | [Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6910649/): problems that should be acknowledge during neuroimaging data analysis (low statistical power, flexibility in data analysis, software errors etc.)
* *Variability in the analysis of a single neuroimaging dataset by many teams* (Nature/ Rotem Botvinik-Nezer et al.) | [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2314-9): analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions
