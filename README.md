### Articles

#### Unreliable Science (*and how to try overcome this issue)

* *Why Most Published Research Findings Are False* (PLOS/ John Ioannidis) | [Paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) / [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Most_Published_Research_Findings_Are_False): an essay written by John Ioannidis (Stanford School of Medicine); author argues that a large number of papers in medical research contain results that in fact cannot be replicated and are a false positive results
* *How scientists fool themselves – and how they can stop* (Nature/ Regina Nuzzo) | [Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/526182a) / [PDF](https://www.nature.com/articles/526182a.pdf): cognitive fallacies in research and debiasing techniques
* *Power failure: why small sample size undermines the reliability of neuroscience* (Nature/ Katherine S. Button et al.) | [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3475): low statistical power and its influence on true/false effects
* *Scanning the horizon: towards transparent and reproducible neuroimaging research* (Nat Rev Neurosci/ Russell A. Poldrack et al.) | [Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6910649/): problems that should be acknowledge during neuroimaging data analysis (low statistical power, flexibility in data analysis, software errors etc.)
* *Variability in the analysis of a single neuroimaging dataset by many teams* (Nature/ Rotem Botvinik-Nezer et al.) | [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2314-9): analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions
* *How to get statistically significant effects in any ERP experiment* (and why you shouldn't) (Psychophysiology/ Steven J. Luck & Nicholas Gaspelin) | [Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5178877/): the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how common and seemingly innocuous methods for quantifying and analyzing ERP effects can lead to very high rates of significant-but-bogus effects
* *Slowed canonical progress in large fields of science* (PNAS/ Johan S. G. Chu &  James A. Evans) | [Paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2021636118): "Examining 1.8 billion citations among 90 million papers across 241 subjects, we find a deluge of papers does not lead to turnover of central ideas in a field, but rather to ossification of canon. Scholars in fields where many papers are published annually face difficulty getting published, read, and cited unless their work references already widely cited articles. New papers containing potentially important contributions cannot garner field-wide attention through gradual processes of diffusion."
* *False-positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant* (Joseph P. Simmons & Leif D. Nelson) | [Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611417632): "First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates."
* *Revised standards for statistical evidence* (PNAS/ Valen E. Johnson) | [Paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1313476110): "The lack of reproducibility of scientific research undermines public confidence in science and leads to the misuse of resources when researchers attempt to replicate and extend fallacious research findings. (...) Modifications of common standards of evidence are proposed to reduce the rate of nonreproducibility of scientific research by a factor of 5 or greater."
* *The file drawer problem and tolerance for null results* (Robert Rosenthal) | [Paper](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~cmckenzie/Rosenthal1979PsychBulletin.pdf): "For any given research area, one cannot tell how many studies have been conducted but never reported. The extreme view of the "file drawer problem" is that journals are filled with the 5% of the studies that show Type I errors, while the file drawers are filled with the 95% of the studies that show nonsignificant results."
* *Is there a large sample size problem?* (Richard A. Armstrong) | [Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/opo.12618) & *The paradox of large samples* (S. Kunte & A. P. Gore) [Paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24093874): statistical issues with large sample sizes
* *Do we really measure what we think we are measuring?* (Dario Gordillo et al.) | [Paper](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(23)00094-9)

#### Other articles
* *A hitchhiker’s guide to working with large, open-source neuroimaging datasets* (Corey Horien et al.) | [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01005-4): "Here we offer practical tips for working with large datasets from the end-user’s perspective. We cover all aspects of the data lifecycle: from what to consider when downloading and storing the data to tips on how to become acquainted with a dataset one did not collect and what to share when communicating results"
